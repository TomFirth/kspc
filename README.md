## Run the App

### iOS (on macOS): 
Run: `cd /client/ && npx react-native run-ios`
Alternatively, you can open the project in Xcode and run it from there by pressing the "Play" button.

### Android:
Make sure your Android emulator is running or your Android device is connected, then run: `cd /client/ && npx react-native run-android`

### Development Server
React Native uses Metro to bundle JavaScript. Run: `cd /client/ && npx react-native start`

Optional Tools:
Expo CLI: You can also use Expo, a toolchain built around React Native, which makes development easier. Expo handles many configurations for you. Install Expo globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
Then, to create an Expo-managed app, run: `expo init kpsc`
